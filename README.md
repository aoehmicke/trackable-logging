# Trackable Logging

This project shows how to set up a `X-Request-Id` in various software systems.
This ID can be used in logs to identify a process chain across multiservice boundaries.
If you have a log collection in a systems like Graylog or Kibana, 
then it is really a boon to have an ID filter available.
